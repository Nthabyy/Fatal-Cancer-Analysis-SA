# Fatal Cancer Analysis in South Africa

## Overview

The **Fatal Cancer Analysis in South Africa** project aims to analyze and visualize the patterns and trends of fatal cancer cases in South Africa. This project leverages **Python**, **Matplotlib**, and **Power BI** to conduct thorough data analysis and provide actionable insights.

---

## Problem Statement

Cancer is a leading cause of death globally, and South Africa is no exception. Understanding the patterns of fatal cancer cases, including the types of cancer.

This analysis aims to:
- Examine trends in cancer-related deaths over time.
- Identify regions with the highest fatal cancer rates.
- Create visualizations to present insights in an easily interpretable format.

---

## Data Collection

The data used in this analysis was sourced from statistics SA and cancer registries. The dataset includes the following key variables:
- **Cancer Type**: The specific type of cancer (e.g., lung, breast, prostate).
- **Gender**: Male or Female.
- **Mortality Rate**: Number of deaths due to cancer in a given period.

---

## Data Cleaning and Preprocessing

The dataset undergoes several preprocessing steps to ensure it is ready for analysis:
- **Handling Missing Data**: Missing or incomplete data entries are handled using imputation techniques or removal, depending on the severity.
- **Data Transformation**: Categorical variables like cancer types and regions are encoded for easier analysis.

---

## Data Analysis

Using **Python** and libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib**, we perform various analyses:
- **Trend Analysis**: We examine how cancer mortality rates have changed over the years.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigating the relationship between cancer types and patient demographics (e.g., age, gender).
The analysis provides insights into the most prevalent types of cancer and the demographic groups most affected by them.

## Data Visualization

Data visualization is a key part of this project, helping to communicate the findings clearly. We use **Matplotlib** and **Power BI** to create various types of charts and graphs:

- **Cancer Mortality Trends**: A time series graph showing how cancer deaths have evolved over the years in South Africa.
- **Cancer Types by Mortality**: A bar chart that displays the most common cancer types associated with fatal outcomes.

Below are the visualizations created for this analysis:

## Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive analysis of fatal cancer trends in South Africa, with insights into the most prevalent cancer types, By utilizing **Python**, **Matplotlib**, and **Power BI**, we are able to present the findings in clear, informative visualizations that can guide public health strategies and awareness campaigns.

## Future Work

- **Machine Learning**: Incorporating machine learning models to predict cancer mortality trends based on demographic data.
- **More Regional Insights**: Analyzing data at a more granular regional level to identify areas with the highest needs for healthcare resources.
